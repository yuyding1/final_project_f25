        <h2>Housing Production</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial support:</strong><br>
            Explore state-funded programs such as the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mshda/neighborhoods/mi-neighborhood" target="_blank"> MSHDA MI Neighborhood Program</a> and the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mshda/developers/employer-assisted-housing" target="_blank"> Employer-Assisted Housing Fund</a> to incentivize greater-scale of housing-unit production, especially for the workforce.<br>
            Leverage financial tools, including <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/treasury/local/lafd/tif" target="_blank">Tax Increment Financing (TIF)</a>, <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/taxes/property/exemptions/nez/neighborhood-enterprise-zone-nez-act">Neighborhood Enterprise Zones (NEZ)</a>, and <a href="files/pilot.pdf" target="_blank">Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)</a> to fill development's financial gaps for affordable units.</li>
            <li><strong>Zoning reform & policy review:</strong><br>
            Pilot zoning reform based on the American Planning Association recommendations and the <a href="https://www.mt-pleasant.org/departments/planning_and_community_development/master_plan_2050.php">City Master Plan</a> to promote more efficient and sustainable land use and accommodate additional housing.<br>
            Streamline the development approval process to expedite project timelines and reduce administrative barriers, overall helping incentivize market-rate housing production.

        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Housing Quality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Financial support:</strong><br>

            Promote the State's downpayment assistance programs, mortgage credit certificates and rate relief mortgages to save lower-income homebuyers with purchasing costs, enabling those funds to go towards home improvements.
</li>
            <li><strong>Property maintenance:</strong><br>
            Continue to educate and enforce the <a href="https://www.mt-pleasant.org/departments/code_enforcement/international_property_maintenance_code.php" target="_blank">International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC)</a> through regular code inspections to ensure homeowners and landlords are maintaining and improving their properties.<br>
            Conduct annual rental license inspections to ensure compliance and uphold housing quality standards.</li>
