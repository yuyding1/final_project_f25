        <h2>Knowing Housing Prices in the City</h2>
            <p>
                Affordable housing is defined as housing for which a household spends no more than 30% of its gross income on total housing costs, including rent/mortgage, utilities, taxes, and insurance. A household is considered cost-burdened if it spends more than 30% of its income on housing and severely cost-burdened if it spends more than 50%. The median household income (MHI) in the city in 2025 is $46,168, reflecting the combined income of all members of a household, regardless of the number of people living there.
