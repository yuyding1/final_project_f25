<p>Welcome to the City of Mt. Pleasant. Located in the center of Michigan’s lower peninsula, Mt. Pleasant has a rich and diversified history.  
<br>
As home to Central Michigan University, Mid-Michigan College and two of the region’s most heralded health and hospital centers, we offer a vital and energetic lifestyle with amenities not often found in a community retaining a true “hometown” feel. Surrounded by lakes, rivers, forests, and healthy farmland, Mt. Pleasant offers its residents, businesses, and visitors a vibrant place to live, work, learn and play. 
<br>
The City's 21,000+ full-time residents have chosen one of the state's most "walkable" and safest communities where the arts are celebrated, parks are protected, and the entrepreneurial spirit is supported. Come home to Mt. Pleasant.</p>
